# New Initiative: Reward Program for the Compute Subnet Community

We're excited to announce a new initiative to reward our community members for their valuable contributions to the Compute Subnet! Our goal is to foster innovation, improve the network's functionality, and enhance user experience through community-driven development. If you've been looking to contribute, now is the perfect time to get involved and potentially earn a reward for your efforts.

## Reward Range

We are offering rewards ranging from $600 to $10,000 for pull requests (PRs) that add significant value to the Compute Subnet. The aim is to acknowledge the hard work, creativity, and impact of contributions that help propel the network forward.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Value Addition**: The PR should introduce features, fixes, or enhancements that significantly benefit the Compute Subnet's functionality, performance, security, or user experience.
- **Quality of Work**: High-quality code, documentation, and adherence to best practices will be key factors in our evaluation.
- **Innovation**: We appreciate innovative solutions that address existing challenges or introduce new opportunities for the network.

## Process and Payment

1. **Submit Your PR**: Contribute to the Compute Subnet by submitting your PR through our GitHub repository. [Submit Here](https://github.com/neuralinternet/compute-subnet)
2. **Review Process**: Our team will thoroughly review each submission to assess its impact, quality, and the value it adds to the network. This process may involve discussions, requests for changes, or further clarifications to ensure the contribution meets our standards and objectives.
3. **Reward Determination**: Once a PR is approved, the reward amount will be determined based on the contribution's overall value and the effort involved. We aim to make this process as transparent and fair as possible.
4. **Legal Compliance**: To comply with tax regulations and ensure a smooth payout process, we require all contributors eligible for a reward to complete a W-8 (for non-U.S. persons) or W-9 (for U.S. persons) form. This step is crucial for us to file the necessary 1099 forms and cover the expenses associated with these filings.
5. **Payment Release**: Upon successful review of the contribution and completion of the required tax documentation, the reward will be processed and released to the contributor.

## Get Started

This initiative is open to developers, technologists, and enthusiasts passionate about decentralized computing and blockchain technology. Whether you're a long-time member of our community or new to the Compute Subnet, we encourage you to dive in, explore open issues, and bring your ideas to life.

Together, we can build a stronger, more efficient, and inclusive Compute Subnet. We're looking forward to seeing your innovative contributions and are excited to reward your efforts in making a significant impact on the network!
